			I consent to having my pictures and/or videos taken and stored in Juvly's systems. Such photographs and videos will not be used for any purpose except internal training without my express permission. I understand and agree that all services rendered to me are charged directly to me and that I am personally responsible for payment prior to receiving services. I further agree in the event of non-payment, cancellation of payment or any payment issues, to bear the cost of collection, and/or the court cost and legal fees, should those be required. I consent to being signed up for the rewards programs so I can earn free points to get discounts on my treatments. I consent to email, text and phone communications related to post procedure care and follow-ups. I am not aware that I am pregnant. I am not trying to get pregnant. I am not lactating (nursing). I do not have or have not had any major illnesses which would prohibit me from receiving this treatment. I certify that I do not have multiple allergies or high sensitivity to medications, including but not limited to lidocaine. I am completely of sound mind and am fully aware of all the risks and possible complications of this procedure. I understand this procedure is one hundred percent voluntary. I acknowledge that no guarantee has been given regarding the results that may be obtained. I have read the material given to me and I am fully satisfied that all of my questions and concerns have been addressed. I understand that I am required to attend post-procedure check-ups as advised by Juvly Aesthetics and that I am required to follow all post treatment instructions. I have received and fully understand the post treatment instructions. I have advised my provider of my medical history including all previous medical conditions and medications currently being taken. Alternatives to the procedures and options that I am choosing to get today have been fully explained to me. I consent to the administration of such anaesthetics considered necessary or advisable. I understand that all forms of anaesthesia involve risk and the possibility of complications and injury. I am aware that there may be other risks or complications not discussed that may occur. I also understand that during the course of the proposed procedure, unforeseen conditions may be revealed requiring the performance of additional procedures, and I authorize such procedures to be performed. I acknowledge that no guarantees or promises have been made to me concerning the results of this procedure or any treatment that may be required as a result of this procedure. I understand there are no refunds and that multiple treatments are often required to achieve noticeable and lasting outcomes. I also understand that promotional items have no refund value. By accepting and signing, I acknowledge that I have read this informed consent, I understand it, and I agree to the treatment with its associated risks. I hereby give consent to perform this and all subsequent treatments with the above understood. I hereby release the Medical Director(s), the Juvly provider performing the treatment and Juvly Aesthetics from liability associated with this procedure. I have been given the opportunity to ask questions and my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I also state that I read and write in English. I hereby consent to the Microblading procedure, and hereby authorize the Juvly provider to perform the Microblading procedure. Microblading is a type of tattoo treatment that allows for controlled induction of pigment in the brow area to fill in emptiness or to add pigment for shaping the brows. This treatment typically lasts 1-3 years and most clients will have to come back for touch ups once a year depending on the after care at home. Side Effects After the procedure, the treated area of skin will be red and flushed in appearance, but barely visible from the pigment applied on the brows. Bruising may also occur and will self resolve. You may experience skin tightness and mild sensitivity to touch on the area being treated. This will diminish greatly after 24-72 hours. You may also experience mild scanning and dryness on or around the brow area. As with any medical procedure, there is a risk for infection and allergic reaction to the products used in this procedure. Microblading and similar procedures may stimulate or spread Herpes Simplex virus in patients with a history of this condition. Inform your provider if you have any history of HSV, cold sores, fever blisters, or shingles. Contraindications Microblading treatment is contraindicated for patients with: vitiligo, keloid scars, scleroderma, collagen vascular diseases or cardiac abnormalities, a hemorrhagic disorder or haemostatic dysfunction, or active skin infection. Precautions and Warnings Microblading treatment has not been evaluated in the following patient populations, as such, precautions should be taken when determining whether to treat: women who are pregnant or nursing; keloid scars; patients with history of eczema, psoriasis and other chronic conditions; patients with history of actinic (solar) keratosis; patients with history of herpes simplex infections; diabetics or patients with wound-healing deficiencies; patients on immunosuppressive therapy; and skin with presence of raised moles or warts or targeted area. I understand that results will vary among Individuals. I understand that although I may see a change after my first treatment, I may require more than one treatment to make sure the pigment stays. I am aware that Microblading is semi-permanent and will last up to 3 years. I understand some clients may experience a hypersensitive reaction to Hibiclens, alcohol, or acetone, or to other prep or cleaning solutions.I consent to receive promotional messages and marketing messages via email and sms from Juvly.
